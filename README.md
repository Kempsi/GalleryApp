- Projects goal was to learn using pages in WPF. Learned alot again, but project started
  to begin looking extremely messy and "spaghetti code-like-y", so decided to can the project.

- Really enjoyed making the UI modern and had a insipiration picture of a already made software (Windows 10 gallery app?)

- Had also fun creating custom usercontrols and learning to use pages as view switches. When I had to implement
  logic into the actual software, that's when the problems started to appear.

- I've been trying to slowly learn MVVM-model, but at the moment it seems really difficult to understand
  and I think this project would have needed it badly to be actually develop further.

- In the end, I'm glad I tried to do this and learnt a lot once again.
